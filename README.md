# COMP0034 Skeleton Dash app for Coursework 1 LSA 2020-21

## Setup
You should already know how to do the following if you completed the Moodle course activities. If you have forgotten then refer to the documentation for your IDE (e.g. PyCharm) for how to do this.
- Create a project in your IDE (e.g. PyCharm) by cloning the repository from GitHub. 
- Create a venv in your project. 
- Install the requirements from requirements.txt. 
- â€¢	Place a copy of your data set in the `data` directory of the project structure. 

## Code structure
- `data` save your data files (likely `.csv` format) to this directory
- `assets` is optional and can be used for additional files such as image files (.jpg, .png, etc)
- `lsa_app.py` configures and creates the Dash app, you will need to edit this with your own Dash code
- `requirements.txt` contains the libraries you will need to install for the app to run. 

## Using and modifying the Dash app code
You can use this Dash app template to present your chart portfolio for coursework 1.

You may edit the app in any way you wish (e.g. change the stylesheet, add or remove pages).

Note that if you change a filename or variable it is recommended that you use a refactoring method in the IDE e.g. in PyCharm use menu option **Refactor | Rename**. This ensures any reference to the name is also updated.

You may also delete this template and create your own Dash app from scratch. 

### Adding your charts
There is a placeholder chart and text in `lsa_app` that illustrates a basic chart and commentary.
You should delete this and replace with your own charts and text.
